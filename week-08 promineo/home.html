        One day we went to a restaurant where a family of four had also come to dine.<br>
       None of them spoke to each other as they were all busy on their cell phones.<br> Even after the food was served they were lost in their own world! The father went out to take a call.<br> The mother was busy chatting with her friends, while the son and daughter were playing games! I wondered why they had come to the restaurant. In another incident, two boys were so badly addicted to gaming sites that they began eating on the computer chair itself and even answered nature’s call there.
         Both had to be taken for therapy. <br>When we start valuing gadgets more than people, it affects our health and happiness. Addiction to gadgets impacts our well-being and relationships. <br>Today, we can’t imagine our life without i-pads, TVs, mobile phones, laptops etc, as they give us information and keep us connected. Yes, internet is rightly called a ‘New Educative Technique’. It helps us find answers to everything. The jobless find jobs. You can book movie  tickets and even holidays on the net. You can get the latest news just by surfing the net. Technology is a boon for society if used correctly. So let’s get our focus right and spend more time in the real world instead of the virtual world.
